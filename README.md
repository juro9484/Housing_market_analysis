# Housing_market_analysis
Transposed raw excel file to perform ETL in jupyter. Imported the data from the CSV file and cleaned it, removing non-numeric data and unnecessary columns, converting columns to numeric data types, and changing column names to fit into a SQL cloud warehouse table format for further analysis. Visualized the data using matplotlib to get a sense of most important attributes to a house price. Used sklearn library to create regression models to determine which attributes are most correlated to the sale price of a property.
